This repo is dedicated to most asked problems in coding interviews for freshers.

## Instructions
1. Please read the problem statement throughly.
2. Try to solve it by your own.
3. If you want some help then check diy-java repository first.
4. If still unable to solve the problem then you may check solutions-java repository.
5. We shall share Javascript and Python code also in the same way.


## Problem 1
Write a program to accept one integer. Then print every digit of that integer in a newline and start from one's place.
